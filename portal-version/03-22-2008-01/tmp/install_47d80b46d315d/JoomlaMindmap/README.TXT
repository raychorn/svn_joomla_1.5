What does this tool do ?
------------------------
This tool retreives all content items, weblinks, newsfeeds and component items from mainmenu directly
from the Joomla database and creates nice flash based mind maps from the structure.

License information:
--------------------
This software is donationware. If you want to remove the branding and the backlink, 
please make a donation of 50 € via paypal to mustafa@goermezer.de. I will tell you how you can 
remove the branding.

If you don`t want to donate, it is only allowed to implement this application into your site as it is. 
But you have to leave the "This sitemap was generated by JoomlaMindmap" and the backlink to www.goermezer.de !!!

Installation instructions:
--------------------------
* Please upload all files of this archive into a directory of your Webserver where you want to see the mind map. 
* Put the absolute pathname (beginning from root) to the Joomla configuration.php into the file config.php in the 
  JoomlaMindmap directory. Example: /home/www/web177/html/configuration.php
Now you are ready to dynamically generate nice mind maps from Joomla!

If you want to see the mind map in your template (not in a separate window) you have to create a wrapper link
with the menu manager to JoomlaMindmap: Usually http://yourdomain.com/JoomlaMindmap/index.php .

Your wrowser must have installed the Flash plugin and Javascript must be enabled.
